## Overview

**Project Overview:**  
This project focuses on building a job market analysis platform using data scraped from various job boards. By storing this data in a structured format, the platform allows us to derive insights such as the most in-demand job roles, required skills, and technology trends. An interactive dashboard will be created to visualize these insights and make the data accessible for analysis.

**Objectives:**
- Scrape job posting data from online job boards across the US for the past few years.
- Clean and store the data in a database or dataset for analysis.
- Create visualizations to display trends in job postings, such as popular job titles, in-demand skills, and technology usage.
- Provide an interactive dashboard for easy exploration of the data.
